# ReverseString

I Created Model ReverseString with two properties Name and ReverseName

In Index View I added input "Name" to pass data to be reversed  and other disabled input to show the reversed data.

In HomeController I created GET method Index in which I display the Index view and Post Method which is reversing the posted string and displaying it.

In HomeController I created static Reverse Method which takes string as parameter and returns reversed string by recursion.
